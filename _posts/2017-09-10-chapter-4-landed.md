In unison, the bed pods opened. Addy and Steve sat up slowly, the paralytic still wearing off. They each looked at each other and then their watches. The readout was exactly as they had when they had laid down: Steven&#39;s 22.1 above another 22.1, Addy&#39;s 31.7 over above another 31.7. They were both confused.

<br/>

&quot;Did it not work? Did we not go anywhere?&quot; Addy asked Steven not expecting him to have an answer.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so, they likely would have opened the doors and started barking orders at us if we were still on Earth. I feel a deep sense of calm. A calm I haven&#39;t felt since childhood. The feeling of not having a commanding officer.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t speak so soon. I was definitely told I was in command on this mission. Also didn&#39;t you have a mother. You&#39;ve always had a commanding officer.&quot;

&quot;The people who put you in charge have been dead thousands of years. Those orders, as with all other orders given to us by any other man are null and void. They told us we are on our own.&quot;

<br/>

Addy was well aware that she was not in command, that they were a two-person team. It tickled her ego but also stung a bit at how convincing of an argument Steven felt he needed to make.

&quot;Well then _companion_, let&#39;s assess our situation.&quot;

<br/>

&quot;You want me to check out what&#39;s going on outside?&quot;

&quot;No, let&#39;s asses our more immediate situation: this box, provisions, and whatever instructions they left us.&quot;

<br/>

Steven and Addy took their first good hard looks at the inside of the box, still seated in their bed pods. In contrast to the outside of the box, the inside was wall to wall white, with a few nobs and dials and hinges which were painted various primary colors. However, they could both tell that the inside of the machine was made of the same stuff as the outside. The same smoothness and uniformity of color other than the few painted bits gave it away. As Steven was still looking around Addy asked:

<br/>

&quot;What&#39;s your assessment of the place?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t even looked at everything yet.&quot;

&quot;Well mine is: this is a safe place, a place one can rest, but not a place meant to live in. Let&#39;s check the lockers over there for supplies.&quot;

&quot;So, it&#39;s a base, but not a home--so to speak.&quot;

<br/>

Addy got up with a nod and opened the floor to ceiling locker and inspected the contents on the shelf at eye level. Packages labeled, &quot;food stuff: 1 day complete nutrition,&quot; a book labeled, &quot;Unit 675.78 guide book,&quot; and a laminated sheet of paper titled &quot;Mission Guide.&quot;  In that moment, Addy remembered that she was still naked. She looked back at Steven who was lying on the bed, covering his privates with his hands staring straight up at the ceiling above his bed pod.

<br/>

Addy reached into the locker and threw on the pants sitting on the lowest shelf. As she grabbed the shirt to put it on, she noted there was no bra and thought, _I may never have to wear a bra again, small victory for the day_. She put on the shirt which after was pulled on held her breasts in place comfortably, but it wasn&#39;t skin tight looking. _Well isn&#39;t that a fancy shirt._

<br/>

She turned and tried to open the locker by Steven&#39;s bed pod, but when she placed her hand on the side where her handle was, the handle wasn&#39;t there. She slid her hand up the side and found it a few inches higher than where hers was. She opened the door, grabbed Steven a set of clothing and tossed them to him.

<br/>

Steven replied with a, &quot;thanks&quot; and slipped into the pants find a similar experience with the pants as Addy had with the shirt.

&quot;What all is in mine?&quot;

&quot;Food, another set of cloths, and a harmonica of all things.&quot;

&quot;Funny, I don&#39;t play the harmonica.&quot;

<br/>

Addy took a deep breath and closed her eyes and the locker.

<br/>

&quot;But I can learn. Growing up I played the flutes my dad made. If there are still trees left, I can make us some flutes to. Well even if there isn&#39;t as long as I can find something I can hollow out by drilling I can make a flute.&quot;

Addy sat back down on her bed. Steven, now fully clothed, sat up matching her posture.

&quot;What&#39;s our first move?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I think get a peek at what&#39;s going on outside. I feel the need to get out of this box even if it is just for a few moments. Then we get back in here and make a plan.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we at least read the mission guide first?&quot;

&quot;I _wrote_ the mission guide, I _am_ the mission guide.&quot;

&quot;Ha! That was the first joke I&#39;ve heard you tell.&quot;

&quot;That wasn&#39;t a joke.&quot;

&quot;It was a pun, that&#39;s a joke whether you like it or not. Maybe I will rub off on you a little after all.&quot;

<br/>

A smug look came across Steven&#39;s face and Addy shook her head at him softly. &quot;Alright let&#39;s go.&quot; Steven said standing up. When his feet hit the floor, he paused and looked down at his feet. Trying to make up for the pause he moved quickly to the front of the box.

<br/>

He looked at the several knobs that were on the right-hand side of the door near the latch. The knobs were all in the shape of a small hand making a thumbs-up gesture. Above them read: Oxygen, Temperature, Radiation. Addy walked up behind him and inspected the knobs as well.

&quot;Okay, based on those knobs we should be safe to go outside.&quot; Steven commented.

&quot;Well, based on these knobs there is enough oxygen, the temperature and radiation levels are likely within acceptable ranges. That certainly doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s safe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you say that, because that means we get to put on those&quot; he said pointing to the space suit hanging on the wall inches a couple feet or so to their right. &quot;Space suits! How cool!&quot;

Addy inspected her suit and after a few moments turned to Steven and said, &quot;we should probably read the instru,&quot; she trailed off seeing that Steven was already halfway into his suit and snapping shut the system of clasps on the boots of the suit.

<br/>

Addy slipped into her suit and put on the helmet which snapped shut automatically with a satisfying click. Steven pointed at the black material that attached the body of the suit to the helmet and asked, &quot;look familiar?&quot;

Addy gave him a confused look and shook her hand.

&quot;It&#39;s definitely the same stuff the ship&#39;s is made of. I don&#39;t know what it is exactly, but let&#39;s just say someone had to _science the fuck out of something to make this stuff&quot;_ (he said air quoting). If it wasn&#39;t so likely that my life is going to depend on this stuff doing its job consistently, I&#39;d take it apart and figure out what it is.&quot;

&quot;Interesting, you didn&#39;t strike me as the science-e type, more of the subordinate, sometimes competent, soldier.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just projecting what you are comfortable around. They hand-picked us two from all of humanity for this. I bet if you can think of a skill you don&#39;t have I have it, and vice-versa&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to take a catalog of that at some point.&quot;

&quot;If you think that will help.&quot;

<br/>

Steven walked over to the sort of archway that separated the space he and Addy were standing in and the and the area with the bed pods and the lockers. He pawed at the sides of the archway looking for the airlock button he presumed would be there, but did not find one.

<br/>

&quot;Where is the airlock button?&quot;

&quot;There are some settings on this door handle, other than open and closed.&quot;

&quot;What are they?&quot;

&quot;Locked, Armed, Ready, Open&quot;

&quot;Try turning it to armed.&quot;

<br/>

She did and the archway behind them closed toward the middle slowly. The pieces snapped together with the same click as their helmets. Steven inspected the archway, which he would now call a wall. He found it to be just like the outside of the ship—completely flush, with no signs of a seam where the two pieces met.

<br/>

&quot;Looks like they built the airlock to be idiot proof, can&#39;t go out unless the inner area is sealed off. We&#39;re not exactly trained astronauts, probably a good call on their part,&quot; Steven said with laughter in his voice.

&quot;I once heard an expression that will stick with me forever, _the more fool proof you make things, the more the world will provide you with stronger and stronger idiots.&quot;_

&quot;Wasn&#39;t that George Carlin?&quot;

&quot;No, he said &#39;never argue with an idiot, they will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience&#39;&quot;

&quot;You are full of advice for how to deal with idiocy aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Well, I did have to prepare for this mission, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Joke number 2! At this rate, I am going to lose count.&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

<br/>

The box made two clicks in unison with Addy moving the latch impatiently to open skipping any waiting at the armed state—a move she even found uncharacteristically impatient and non-tactical.

<br/>

She pushed the door open and the lights in the box turned off and orange colored dusk light filled the airlock. Addy stepped out and Steve watched as few grains of sand climb their way into the box as she stepped out. The grains were larger than he would have expected. Not quite pebbles but in no way fine.

<br/>

Addy outside told Steven:

&quot;Come out, we&#39;re in no immediate danger that I can see.&quot;

&quot;The worst kind of immediate danger then.&quot;

<br/>

This was the first time they realized they were speaking through coms in their suits. Everything had sounded so natural while they were in the box that neither took note.

<br/>

&quot;Okay, coming out.&quot;

Addy looked back at Steve as he stepped out of the box carefully, &quot;Well I guess we&#39;re home. I see a forest of some sort up those hills to the west.&quot;

Steven gave no response as he looked around.

<br/>

Addy looked eastward out to where the golden twilight had faded into the black of night. Her heart somehow was at easy. She was on unknown terrain, but her greatest fear was never making it back to Earth. This fear was set at ease by what she was seeing.

<br/>

She looked back at Steven again who was looking up at the sky to the north. The scientist words repeated in Stevens mind, _the machine will detect the gravity and rematerialize you._

<br/>

&quot;Okay it&#39;s about time we got back in.&quot;

<br/>

Steven surveyed with one last slow spin taking in the surroundings, still not having taken more than two steps out of the box. Addy stepped by him and into the box and waited for him to reenter. She watched as he stepped up to the box, stopped, crouched and jumped. He then reached down and picked up some of the sand and played with his index finger. He let the sand fall out of his hand and looked up at Addy.

<br/>

&quot;What was that all about?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you once the box is closed.&quot;

&quot;Well get in already then.&quot;

<br/>

Steven stepped in and Addy locked the door behind them. The box made its clicking noises and as Addy sent the door latch through its reverse phases. The lights came on accompanied by a whooshing sound of air being sucked out of the airlock and then another pair of clicks followed by another whoosh of air which blew the remaining specks of sand between the fingers of Steven&#39;s gloves. In the commotion of the clicking and the swooshing Addy and Steven had not noticed that the divide between the airlock and the bed pod areas had opened.

<br/>

Addy took off her helmet first and continued her inquiry of Steven&#39;s peculiar actions outside, &quot;Ok what had to wait?&quot; feeling a bit impatient with this stranger who she, as yet, did not have a good read on. Not having a read on people was not a condition she found herself in often and was certainly not one she felt comfortable in.

<br/>

Steven, knowing that there was no safer place for her to react and handle what he was about to say and waiting wouldn&#39;t do any good began, &quot;There&#39;s no good way to say this, so I&#39;ll just say it bluntly. I don&#39;t think we are on Earth.&quot;

<br/>

A panic quickly overtook Addy. Her mind went blank. She felt like her whole body was overheating.

<br/>

When she took her next breath, she forced herself to calm down. Her panic attack was so quick that Steven, had he not been paying very close attention, might have missed that anything had happened. Holding back an outburst she asked:

<br/>

&quot;How did you come to this conclusion?&quot;

&quot;Well umm..&quot; he stammered purposefully, &quot;when we first met, I had uh a very particular reaction, to your.. physique. And well since when we landed, things are a bit less well perky. And believe me it&#39;s no fault of yours… The gravity is pulling, harder on your body than what it is used to.&quot;

A look of annoyance and confusion toggled on Addy&#39;s face. _He&#39;s such a pig. But now that he mentions it, I feel like everything has been a bit sluggish since we woke up. Chalking it up to side effects of the dematerialization and disorientation was stupid. That&#39;s not how it works. I should have been exactly the same as when I first laid down in that pod._

<br/>

She looked at her feet and bounced on the balls of her feet a little.

<br/>

&quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist a little joke. You look like you are noticing it now. I just hoped I&#39;d cut the tension a bit.&quot;

&quot;Maybe leave the jokes to me for a while. Or better yet let&#39;s both refrain from jokes when serious matters are the topic of conversation&quot;

&quot;That is a request I will always fail to complete. It&#39;s just who I am, it&#39;s my coping mechanism I&#39;ve been told.&quot;

<br/>

Bouncing again she said:

&quot;I just thought the dematerialization.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m twice as massive as you give or take. I felt it the moment my feet hit the floor. The effect was, magnified so to speak, for me.&quot;

&quot;Any other signs?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t the horizon feel a bit far off for an open flat dessert plain.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it did.&quot;

&quot;Anything you notice now that you are aware of the situation.&quot;

&quot;The stars were all out of place.&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I looked up back to the east and didn&#39;t recognize a single star or constellation.&quot;

<br/>

Both of them racked their brains trying to make sense of the situation.

<br/>

&quot;So, given all that there are two competing theories now, this is earth and its somehow gained a lot of mass and we&#39;ve travelled far enough in time that the movement of the galaxy and universe has progressed so much that we don&#39;t recognize the night sky or we are on a different planet with perhaps breathable air and what looked like plant life.&quot;

&quot;Things don&#39;t seem to have gone as planned.&quot;

&quot;Either way I think the doctor&#39;s assessment of when we&#39;d land was way off. I can&#39;t speak to any of the rest of his intentions because he didn&#39;t tell them to me. He said 10404. The stars wouldn&#39;t have moved enough by 10404. And if this is another solar system with a life sustaining planet and given and space travel technology of our time we wouldn&#39;t have been going fast enough to get here by 10404.&quot;

<br/>

The weight of what he just said hit Steven all at once. He thought that he should be excited to likely be one of the first humans to reach another solar system. All that he thought of was that everything and everyone he had ever known was not only dead but likely dead forgotten and replaced by hundreds of generations of people and ideas.

<br/>

Addy saw the light and curios demeanor fade from Steven and that worried her. Her experience leading people like him taught her that these kinds of stressful situations were not time for a wandering mind. _I need to keep his mind occupied or he is going to start thinking too much about all of this. Thinking too much in these situations can be lethal. He needs a task, a goal. As do I, but his life depends on it. So I guess mine probably does to._

<br/>

&quot;We&#39;ve got food enough to stay alive for probably 60 days if we ration carefully. So, our first goal is surveying the area to make sure we are physically safe. Then we see if we can find food we can eat here. Then we can figure out what comes next. We&#39;re both in charge of physical security, watch each other&#39;s backs. You are in charge of experimenting with the food we find in the forest on the horizon.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Steven replied sullenly.

<br/>

Addy walked over to her cabinet and grabbed a food bar out of her cabinet, opened it and broke it in half. She handed half of it to Steven and said, &quot;Let&#39;s go back outside and explore the first alien world humans have ever discovered and then we&#39;ll get back to the plan.&quot;

<br/>

Steven took a bite and chewed slowly.

<br/>

&quot;Can I bring the ship instruction manual? That is also top priority I think. I think the ship has more to offer us than we currently know.&quot;

She didn&#39;t think it was wise to let such an important and valuable asset to their survival go outside of the box but decided that it was worth the risk if it would life Steven&#39;s spirit.

<br/>

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, EVA #2 and documentation reading time. What more could a nerd ask for.&quot;
