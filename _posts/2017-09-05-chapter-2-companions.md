# Chapter 2 – Companions

&quot;Addy, welcome,&quot; the scientist began. &quot;Your reputation precedes you, so we won&#39;t delay with pleasantries and get right down to business.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she replied.

&quot;This is Steven, he will be your companion on this mission. You&#39;ll have plenty of time to get acquainted later. Just know that he is as trustworthy as they come.&quot;

Steven noticed that the body language and tone of the room shifted from one of attentive work and casual conversation generally directed toward him to one of stiff formality and chain-of-command-type respect and very noticeably directed toward Addy. _Now is a time for speaking when spoken to,_ he thought.


<br/>

&quot;This is the machine behind me. We will be ready for the commencement of the mission in,&quot; he paused and looked back at a woman typing at a keyboard behind him and asked, &quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;Ten minutes,&quot; she replied.

&quot;Ten minutes she says. I&#39;d say closer to seven. We can make the final preparations synchronously while the dematerialization is happening.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;ve been told, more or less, what is going on, but I feel it is necessary to give a bit more detail about what is about to happen to ensure mission success. First, you will be put in to that machine. There are two bed pods, one for each of you. You will lie down and press the black button on your right on the edge of the bed. This will close the bed pod. You will then click the yellow button which will light a LED in your companion&#39;s bed pod indicating you are ready to begin.

<br/>

When both of you see the green light. Press the red button. This will release a paralytic that will immobilize you to aid in the dematerialization scan. Approximately six seconds later the scans are complete and you will be dematerialized.

<br/>

From then timeline isn&#39;t important for you or what will happen. However, you will be dematerialized and wake when the deep space part of your journey is over. Your mission will have begun. Instructions on how to use the machine are provided as well as mission guidelines, well more like helpful suggestions are provided.

<br/>

Both Addy and Steven thought the scientists wording of the details of the instructions was ominous but they didn&#39;t feel they had time to have him clarify.

<br/>

We will not launch until both of you have consented to mission participation by clicking your black buttons and really committed by pressing the yellow and red ones.

<br/>

Please take a few minutes to prepare yourself. Make peace with your God or gods if you have them. We will let you know when we are ready. Just to be clear, our blast window is based on our fuel capacity and position of the earth is about 12 seconds, so no fucking around. Get ready or one of my less-prepared-and-skilled-than-you colleagues will be taking your place. Please don&#39;t make them go. They will be next to useless on this mission. Our collective scientific knowledge is written to the machine&#39;s hard drive so to speak. The AI of the system takes up as much data storage as your taste-buds, so&quot; he trailed off without finishing his thought and walked back to a desk and begun typing at the laptop that sat on top of it.

<br/>

Prompted by the scientist&#39;s suggestion to make peace with God, Steven began to pray.

_Our Father… who art in heaven_

_Hallowed be thy name._

_Thy kingdom come._

_Thy will be done_

_on earth as it is in heaven._

_Give us this day our daily bread,_

_and forgive us our trespasses,_

_as we forgive those who trespass against us,_

_and lead us not into temptation,_

_but deliver us from evil._

_For thine is the kingdom,_

_and the power, and the glory,_

_for ever and ever._

<br/>

_Heavenly Father, if this not be your will of me make it know to me. These people who have the trust of those I have loved and trusted tell me that this is the only way anyone can change the horrid state we humans have put ourselves in. This seems the right thing to do, but it is, I don&#39;t know, not the calling I thought I&#39;d have to rise to. This was not the cross I thought I&#39;d have to bear._

<br/>

_I accept any suffering that is to come to me for the betterment of my fellow man and to leading them closer to you. Use me as your sword to cut down the veil humanity has put up between ourselves and you._

<br/>

_Not that we have many theologians to weigh in on these kinds of things these days but I have often heard it said that dematerialization or teleporting or whatever causes the death of a person because we strip the soul from the body and what comes out after is no longer human, or at least not the one you granted a soul to. I am sorry if my participation in this is a sin. I don&#39;t want to die, and I don&#39;t want to rip my soul from my body. If it does please welcome me into Love in the next life if it comes to pass this way._

<br/>

_I am so afraid. Afraid for myself and those I love as I leave them behind. I am afraid for my soul. I am afraid for so many things. Give me courage to face the challenges that lie ahead. Lead me down the path that I can do the most good for the most people. You know which I prefer but it does not matter. I put my trust and hope in you—always._

Steve rose from his kneeling position and scanned the room around him. The door to the black box had been opened again. Apparently ready for him and Addy to enter.

<br/>

Once again Steve scanned Addy, this time more slowly and carefully because he had no fear of being noticed. He looked at her meditative posture, cross legged, hands on her needs, palms up, breathing deeply. He was impressed by the calmness of her demeanor in an almost objectively stressful situation. He imagined that his posture looked more like the pleading of a man on his way to the gallows.

<br/>

He looked at her hands and noticed something alarming, a streak of blood came out of her sleeve and just barely on the visible skin on her wrist. He also noticed several scars on her neck and jaw. He was immediately sent off onto a new reason to be anxious about this choice that had to be made. He had never thought the other person joining him on the mission would be a cause for stress. Steven could always find the good in people and find common ground to make a friendship.

<br/>

_What if this is the kind of person I can&#39;t become friends with. What if she is just bad to the core, but they find her necessary. Can I really spend the rest of my life with someone like that?_

<br/>

As Steven worried about this, Addy continued her meditation. She began to tune our all of the sporadic noises filling the room. She did not want to completely block out all thought. She just wanted to find her inner calm enough to analyze the situation fully.

<br/>

Satisfied with her state of mind she began to break do the decision she had to make (a decision she had already spent much time making in the previous months leading up to today) into its smallest elements.

<br/>

_The resistance I have or anyone has ever known it is over. It is suppressed and fully crushed. I don&#39;t agree with the fatalists that our end means the end of all hope of this state of the world being dismantled is over forever and that there is no good left to be had in the world of such control. Personal freedom has to still exist, even if it is only in the quiet of our minds, or in silent glances among friends._

<br/>

_I think that what I am good at no longer can be of much service to mankind as of the last few weeks. Leaving Earth will be easier for me than others because I have few connections to people and none are deep. All of mine have been taken from me._

<br/>

She had to consciously send the thoughts that welled up away to remain calm and focused.

<br/>

_People I trust have told me they have faith in this idea, these scientists and this Steven character. If the organizers were prudent in their decision of choosing us we will work well together. We likely have complementary but not overlapping skills. So, for this to go well I am needed or at least someone like me is needed. There likely aren&#39;t many of me left or at least none other than me who still wish to fight or even know there is even a fight or that there ever was one. That all leads me to my original conclusion I am duty bound to do this. I don&#39;t know of another option that has a potential to bring about a better outcome for..._

<br/>

Can I ask you a question?&quot; Steven asked interrupting Addy&#39;s meditation. &quot;It matters for my making my decision. To do this with you. I don&#39;t mean to disturb you or take these precious few moments you have to make this decision yourself. But the way I see it getting in that thing with you without knowing anything about you seems, well, it seems plain blocked headed if you ask me.&quot;

&quot;I made my decision well before I met you. Ask away.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, we never actually introduced ourselves in the rush of this. It is very nice to meet you Addy. I&#39;m Steven&quot;

<br/>

Addy nodded a small impatient nod in acknowledgment.

<br/>

&quot;Why are you doing this, or considering doing this? I don&#39;t mean why do things need to change, I mean why is it you are lying in that bed tube and not someone else.&quot;

<br/>

Addy opened her eyes and took a deep breath, in that moment really and fully having made her decision to go, and said, &quot;I am going to get in that tube because people I trust have convinced me that it is the best way I can contribute, the only way left to contribute to dismantling the world order and world culture that has destroyed the people I have loved most and countless people I have not known. And you?&quot;

&quot;You said it better than I ever could. I am a soldier. I have been for a long time even though my face might look like I haven&#39;t been anything for very long. People I trust told me I am necessary or at least the best of who was available to them to do this work. They think as you said, this is the only option left. What makes you hesitate? What would you be leaving behind if you left?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve lost almost everything and any hope of reclaiming them.&quot;

&quot;Vengeance then?&quot;

&quot;No, its…&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I need to know,&quot; Steven interrupted. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said this with special care to sound sincere. &quot;Doctor, I am ready whenever you are.&quot;

&quot;Not quite yet,&quot; he replied, &quot;but I am glad you two are finding time to bond. It will be important in the beginning to have allegiance to each other at least in the beginning. For a time, it may seem like it is you two against the universe. I forgot to tell you, I have one other piece of equipment I have not briefed you about.&quot;

<br/>

Handing each of them a watch he said, &quot;These watches will keep track of your age, since your actual birth as well as time spent not in dematerialization. I recommend you wear them always as you may lose track of time if you come in and out of the stasis state often. You will want to be able to keep track of your physical again and you won&#39;t be able to do it with a calendar anymore.&quot;

<br/>

They both put on their watches on their left wrists. Steve looked at Addy and said, well actually now that it won&#39;t be socially ostracizing to be left handed and cause for the cops to take a second look at me for standing out, I guess I can wear my watch on the wrist I&#39;d prefer to wear it on.

<br/>

Both the scientist and Addy smiled in response to what they could see was a liberating moment for Steven.

<br/>

&quot;Alright, strip naked, other than the watches of course, and get in the bed pods,&quot; the scientist said abruptly.

<br/>

Both Addy and Steve shot a confused and nervous look at the scientist, Addy&#39;s having a little bit of agitation and distain.

<br/>

&quot;Your clothes are inefficient from a weight and utility perspective. The machine will supply you with suitable cloths upon landing.&quot;

<br/>

They all stood glancing at each other for a moment until the scientist clapped his hands mockingly and said, &quot;let&#39;s goooo, we don&#39;t have all day for this coy silliness.&quot;

<br/>

They both stripped quickly. Addy tried to do it as mechanically as possible. Steven tried to give it a bit of showmanship for any of those in the room who might be interested, hoping it would at least be amusing.

<br/>

Once they were naked the scientist said, &quot;I&#39;d say thank you and wish you luck and have many colleagues shake your hand but we don&#39;t have time and I don&#39;t congratulate people for doing the right thing even If it takes extraordinary courage or effort. We live in an extraordinary time and it calls for extra-ordinary people.  Get in and I wish you much success.&quot;

<br/>

As he was about to step forward and get into the box a horrifying thought crossed Steven&#39;s mind and he blurted it out, &quot;What if when we come back humanity is gone?&quot;

&quot;On behalf of the humanity you are leaving behind I say this, if you manage to make it back and we are gone, do with Earth as your conscience tells you is best. It was never ours to begin with, but if there is anything worth having left, it&#39;s yours to take care of. And with that I feel I must say, get the _fuck_ in the box.&quot;

<br/>

And so, they did. Addy stepped in with Steven close behind. They laid down in their bed pods and closed them without looking at each other and clicked their black buttons. Addy clicked her yellow button as soon as her bed pod was closed. Steven hesitated for long enough for Addy to notice and to begin to be nervous he would not go through with it. But as soon as the though arose in her mind, she saw the LED lights flash above her prompting her to press the red button which she did without hesitation.

<br/>

They both quickly found themselves chemically immobilized and the scanner quickly did its work.
