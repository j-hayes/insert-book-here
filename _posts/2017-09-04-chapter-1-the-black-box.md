title: Chapter 1 - The Black Box
---
The black box stood ominously in the middle of the windowless, but well light room. Steven estimated it was a little less than twice his height and if he jumped he could probably reach the top.

<br/>

The front side had a door that went two thirds of the way to the top. The only reason that door could be seen was because it was open. The rest of the box was flush-solid black with no visible signs of hinges, screws, rivets, or cracks.

<br/>

Steven watched as one of the lab techs shut the door. The box seemed to absorb more light than it should, making the room, which was filled with florescent light, feel somehow dark.

<br/>

&quot;So, what are you guys building here. A bomb? It&#39;s not exactly my kind of mission nor my specialty,&quot; Stephen remarked unprompted.

&quot;No,&quot; replied the scientist, who had hurriedly greeted him some minutes ago, escorted him to where he now stood, then completely ignored him for some minutes.

&quot;Some other kind of weapon then?&quot;

&quot;Never&quot;

<br/>

Steven counted the men and women in the room: three men and three women in lab coats and one in the black slacks, shirt and hat of the government military. Steven thought, _clearly, she was either a double agent working against the government or wore those cloths as a disguise, because if that weren&#39;t the case everyone here would already be in a black bag instead of dashing around a black box with tools and instruments._

<br/>

No one seemed to be paying the slightest attention to Steven. This sort of irked him, as he was told he was being pulled from his team for an important mission. He pushed down his pride and told himself that, as always, this wasn&#39;t about him. Anything he did was for a higher purpose and for his fellow men.

<br/>

Eventually the scientist, still the only one having acknowledged his presence in the room, walked over and said:
&quot;It looks like your companion is either late or otherwise detained, so, I will start briefing you now. You&#39;ll be responsible for giving her the full details when you both get uhhh,&quot; he paused quickly. Steven thought he was looked like he was trying to avoid certain words, &quot;settled. She has the high-level details of the mission. You&#39;ve been, up to this point, kept in the dark for everyone&#39;s safety—including your own. You&#39;ve been brought here because the resistance is defeated. Thoroughly and utterly. That is something you need to get used to as a fact of your existence.&quot;

<br/>

Steven felt as though his heart had dropped into his stomach.

<br/>

&quot;The only reason we have held on this long is because we have played a gambit. We have made it seem as though we were trying to outlast them, play a long con as it were. We pretended to have more forces, more resources than we actually had. A plan that our top strategists believed couldn&#39;t have made it even seven more days without our bluff being called. Well, they called our bluff, and we will likely make it two days less than we thought.&quot;

<br/>

&quot;What about the other factions, in India and in Siberia?&quot;
&quot;Gone&quot;

&quot;Do the Southerners still make contact? Even though they hate us just as much as they hate anyone else?&quot;

&quot;Swept away with the rest. Even your team broke communication and assimilated back into society. Under orders of course. No need to die senselessly since their cover was not blown.&quot;

&quot;There is no resistance left?&quot;

&quot;Save for you, me, those scuttling geniuses in the corner over there, our body guard, and maybe 3 or 4 people outside of this room, none. Well and of course your companion who should be on her way. This is the last mission of the resistance.&quot;

&quot;So, what is it?&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;d stop asking questions and interrupting, I will tell you. Nod to acknowledge and confirm your understanding.&quot;

Steven nodded.

<br/>

&quot;As I&#39;ve said we held out so we could build this machine. Well really, steal a machine and modify it. But that is just semantics. What is it that we would give up the entire resistance for? Any sane person would ask that I&#39;d think. Well the answer is simple. We didn&#39;t chose to give up the resistance for this machine. We chose our best choice of terrible options. We have not chosen how to win, we have chosen when to lose with the hope that years from now, our loss can help someone, anyone, in some way.&quot;

The scientist took a deep breath and continued:

<br/>

&quot;How do I explain this to you so that you might have the vaguest idea of how it works. Well, you see, ummm, do you know of the teleports the government has?&quot;

Steven nodded.

&quot;Well we stole one. Nasty things. Never wanted to see one with my own eyes. They used the bodies of our compatriots as bio matter to aid in the transporting of more of their soldiers to the battle field—back when we had fighters enough to, to, to engage in something large scale enough to call a battle. What we&#39;ve turned it into is a time machine of sorts.&quot;

&quot;A time machine!?&quot; Steven blurted out.  &quot;Time travel is impossible. Every resistance kid is brought up on stories of resistance scientists sending soldiers back in time to stop the events that led to the government taking control. And every resistance adult eventually learns that the stories are never going to be more than that. Stories. The paradoxes can&#39;t be resolved. I&#39;ve long since been a child—although my face might not show it. Going back in time isn&#39;t possible. This, this is why I was pulled from my team and&quot;

The scientist cut him off from his rant saying, &quot;Who said anything about going backward in time.&quot;

<br/>

The two of them stared each other down for several moments.

<br/>

&quot;If you were paying attention, I told you that we are trying to give aid to the future, not to ourselves. Did you ever even hear the original oath of the resistance,&quot; the scientist said with scathing sarcasm.

All in the room stopped what they were doing and said in unison, &quot;I pledge myself to the future freedom of any and all. To their service, unknown to them, I give my life. Death will be my only freedom until all live free.&quot;

<br/>

Steven&#39;s head drooped as he thought of all those who had _found their freedom_, as it was commonly called, fighting alongside him.

&quot;So, I am going forward in time. To what end? What good is two people somewhere in the future where there is no resistance. The future where the world is filled with the sorry souls raised in the captivity of the kindergartens, without knowing the true meaning of the word freedom, or love, or humanity.&quot;

&quot;Precisely that, there will be two children of humanity, alive and well, who know of a life outside the one taught to them by oppression and misery.&quot;

&quot;And what good is that? I can&#39;t start a resistance. Why the hell did you pick me? If you&#39;ve talked to literally anyone who has even a passing familiarity with me, you&#39;ll know I am an idiot strategist. I am assuming you&#39;ve talked to someone who fits that description, since I somehow find myself in this room talking to you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll address that first thought, as it is critical that you know it, you were selected for this mission carefully, intentionally, and although we didn&#39;t have a lot of options, I&#39;m not sure we could have raised a better man for the job. However, it would take me far too long to explain why that is. So, I won&#39;t. Anyways, the advantage you will have is that there won&#39;t have been a resistance for 1000s of years. You will have been forgotten about completely. A distant memory long forgotten with countless other failed and destroyed things in human history like Babel, Troy, the Titanic, or Betamax tapes.&quot;

&quot;What the hell is Troy?&quot;

&quot;You know what Betamax are, how? Doesn&#39;t matter. Just stories that will be forgotten in the end.&quot;

<br/>

&quot;Okay, so, you are sending me forward in time to start a new resistance. Any advice on how to do that?&quot; Steven said emphasizing the question with a slowed cadence in his voice.

&quot;You&#39;ll find a manual for you in the machine. You can read through that at a later date.&quot;

&quot;How much later?&quot;

The scientist shrugged his shoulders and gave a playful smirk.

<br/>

&quot;This has been the least specific briefing I have ever had for a mission. No wonder it&#39;s going to be my last.&quot;

&quot;Well this whole thing has been improvised from the start. It is so half baked that. Again, I&#39;m off topic with my jokes. Sorry.&quot;

&quot;That puts me well at easy thank you. So how does it work? You mentioned a teleport. How is that going to move me forward in time.&quot;

&quot;Well it won&#39;t. Well, at least it won&#39;t move you any faster than you are already going. You&#39;re taking the long way to the future just like every other particle in the universe. The key difference between you and every other human is that you will be dematerialized as though you were going to go through a teleport, however, we aren&#39;t going to send the data and rematerialize you elsewhere. Were just going to save  you and all of your matter in the machine.&quot;

&quot;And then what? Bury us underground somewhere and unearth us later?&quot;

&quot;My dear boy, you really aren&#39;t much of a strategist are you. That would be too hard to hide and cover up. Eventually we will all be found, tortured, and we&#39;d give up your location. They&#39;d dig you up and pull the machine apart. Well no, they would recycle the parts for some second-rate teleport in some regional capital.&quot;

<br/>

The scientist looked at the machine with dread in his eyes at the thought of the machine being ripped apart for parts. He looked back at Steven and continued:

<br/>

&quot;What we are going to do is rather more exciting. We are going to shoot you off into space,&quot; he said with a renewed gleeful tone.

&quot;Oh, yes, suuure, that&#39;s much more subtle.&quot;

&quot;Indeed, it is.&quot;

&quot;How the hell are you going to shoot us off into space?&quot;

<br/>

The scientist gave out a roaring laugh, &quot;Any scientist with half a brain and the ability to make rocket fuel—so again a scientist with half a brain—can blast something into space. This machine is infinitely, well, much more complicated to pull off. However, this is no time for me to boast. Well it&#39;s the only time I have left so, yeah it was a feat of genius and the people in this room achieved something 100 years ahead of our time. So, yeah, you are welcome.&quot;

&quot;What are you going to do after this rocket you send off gives away your position.&quot;

&quot;After we give our position away—with tremendous style I might add,

&quot;And won&#39;t they just shoot us down.&quot;

 &quot;After we give away out position in tremendous style, they&#39;ll come and torture and kill those of us who remain. They will not shoot you down because they will never expect a rocket capable of reaching orbit launching out of the middle of a third-tier city. In their confusion, they will give you a head start enough to avoid the short-range rockets. A head start enough for you to reach escape velocity. Seeing your trajectory, they will see no need to shoot you down. They&#39;ll assign some poor government astrologist is to track you for years and years. However, they&#39;ll track you to Jupiter where you will fall behind the planet and, to them, appear to fall into its gravitational field and be lost forever. However, a booster rocket will divert your course just enough to slingshot you around the planet and send you to the outer solar system where you will gain a comet like orbit and come back to earth in the year 10404.&quot;

<br/>

The idea that he could be alive—even while giving the scientist the benefit of the doubt for making it possible—seemed, to Steven, impossible to comprehend. He actively dismissed the confusion to be grappled with later.

<br/>

&quot;Okay, so why will they not be expecting me when I return since you are going to be tortured and killed.&quot;

&quot;Well I will give them a lie that they will prefer to the truth, because it coincide with how they see the world and would be a plan they would have used and one they would expect us to use. I will tell them we built a nuke _and__we fucked up the rocket science_. I will have to do my best not to laugh my ass off telling that lie. I am great rocket scientist. Everyone in this room can do rocket science with a pad of paper and a dull pencil. Well except you of course.&quot;

&quot;No shit.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, they will find that all of my friends here have found their freedoms in the fire of the rocket as it bursts from this building. They will find me making a run for the border and they will catch me, drunk as can be on vodka I might add, because I spent my life in a lab, not running marathons. Also, not to mention that I want to get caught.&quot;

<br/>

The room fell silent for a moment with the gravity of the idea that soon not one people that currently stood in the room would be alive or on this planet in a short few days.

<br/>

&quot;Why can&#39;t they run? Why can&#39;t they reassimilate?&quot;

&quot;We decided to cut some corners on automating the rocket launch that requires them to remain in the building—to speed up the timeline of the project. Time, we didn&#39;t exactly need. But we did speed up the timeline enough to let us take a day off and enjoy each other&#39;s company.&quot;

&quot;If it is suicide we&#39;ll let God be the judge. I myself prefer my odds at that than trying to reassimilate into these times,&quot; interjected one of the scientists in the corner typing at a computer keyboard.

<br/>

_So, they are paying attention then._

<br/>

&quot;I have always felt the same. A verse from Romans 12 comes to mind. However, it is still suicide.&quot;

<br/>

The scientist shrugged and went back to work at the computer.

<br/>

&quot;Anyway, they will take my lie,&quot; continued the scientist, &quot;and finding it satisfactory to their view of the world, they will dispatch of me and call it a triumphant day, the day they had wiped any resistance from their world.&quot;

<br/>

Steven nodded his head several times thinking what to say in response, still a little overwhelmed by the whole situation. Changing the subject back to more practical matters he asked:

<br/>

&quot;What do I need to know about this machine?&quot;

<br/>

&quot;Nothing really. It&#39;s all automated. When you are back on Earth, the machine will detect the gravity and rematerialize you. You&#39;ll…&quot;

<br/>

The scientist trailed off as the door opened behind Steven. Steven turned and saw a slender but fit woman dressed in government blacks. Steven quickly eyed her from her toned legs to her slim but curved chest to her short dark hair that just extended out the bottom of her black hat. He was struck by her harsh but beautiful facial features. Bright blue eyes beamed across the room and then sized Steven up as well.

<br/>

Looking him dead in the eyes unblinkingly she said, &quot;Don&#39;t get any ideas. Just because were partners on this doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to be partners in any other way. I already put the love of my life in the ground and my children were taken from me before I even named them. Somewhere they have grown to be children with ideals they never should have learned, taught to them by people they ought never have known. Try your best to keep your mind on more important things.&quot;

<br/>

And with that Steven put any thoughts of romance, lust, or anything of the sort away-sensing this woman was deadly serious about the matter.
