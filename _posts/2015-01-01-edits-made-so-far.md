#Edits 

During the feedback process I am going to keep track of edits here. They will contain spoilers sometimes so don't read this if you haven't read the subsequent chapters. I don't want people to have to re-read chapters though if things get updated either.

## Chapter 3
Removed the line where Addy talks about there not being a bra and how that won't be comfortable. Updated to "I may never have to wear a bra again, small victory for the day."
