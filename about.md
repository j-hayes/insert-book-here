Hello

I am writing a sci-fi. I am writing it and publishing it serially. You can read it here on this website. 

I make no promises about when new content will appear, how long the story will be, or really anything. This is an experiment for me but it is a story I have wanted to write for some time, but have been putting off for some time, with good reason. 

I welcome your constructive feedback and will eventually find a place for you to provide it on this site. 

Let's go on a good old fashioned romp around space and time together, hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
