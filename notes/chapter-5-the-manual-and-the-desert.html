	<div class="divider"></div>

	<p>The first test Addy performed was standing outside until something changed with the suit. After standing outside for an hour, nothing had changed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Bored of standing still, she decided to walk in a spiral around the ship, testing to see if the coms would cut out at some distance. It wasn't for several hours until the sun—this planets sun—had set before anything changed on the suits. A battery indicator appeared on the upper right part of Addy's field of view on the helmet's glass. After watching the notches on the indicatory tick down almost on the hour to the second, Addy calculated that the range was around 24 hours. Finding the battery range sufficient she set off on a longer range non-circular test hike straight to the west.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>At the beginning of the trek she checked in with Steven every minute. However, after 20 minutes of this Steven told her to "shut up and let him think." He was sitting in the box the whole night trying to make sense of the manual they had found in the cupboard.  They then tried every ten minutes. The every-ten-minute-check-ins allowed him to keep focus on the manual to a point. However, after about five minutes of this Steven began worrying about Addy—which was even more distracting. So, they settled at five-minute intervals for check-in.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy would open coms and say, "do you read me?" Steven would then respond with an affirmative grunt. Addy would then quickly describe what she was seeing, which was almost exclusively sand dunes with the occasional rocky ridge line, and which direction she was going.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>At dawn the power indicator began rising. Throughout the night not a single other indicator had appeared. Addy took this to mean that everything was functioning correctly.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After hours of walking and focusing on nothing but her surroundings, Addy finally allowed her mind to wander. She thought of Earth and one of the only other memory of sand she had. Having spent most of her life and resistance career in forested mountains or in cities she had very few encounters with sand. The time her and her company were ordered to come down the mountains and strike a target in the dessert far to the southwest.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>She remembered reading out the protocol for moving through the plain below to her team, which was selecting a new check point every 20km, splitting into groups of five, fanning out, and reconvening at the selected check point. If someone missed the check point time window, they were left behind and out of the care of the resistance. In a world where they were constantly under siege from spies, double agents, and all other manners of infiltration and tracking, it was impossible to trust anyone you didn't have an eye on all the time.</p>

<p>Addy had never been able to know for certain, but she estimated that she had lost more comrades to missed check points than by guns, bombs, knives, or any other type of weapon. In recalling this estimation, she realized that she had seen her last resistance checkpoint and that those who were part of her network likely thought she was dead or worse.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With this thought she realized that she had seen her last resistance checkpoint and that those who were part of her network would think she was dead or worse.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>Do they miss me? Do they mourn me? Did they last long after I was gone?</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>She had not let herself believe that the amount of time necessary for her to get to another planet had passed. Every time the thought came to mind, she had quickly dismissed it as not relevant to the current situation. However, now that her mental energy was completely zapped, she could not block it out anymore.  She was still holding out hope that Steven was wrong. If that was the case, it was likely that humanity had died out on Earth. This thought too was too morbid, and she actively searched for anything else to think about.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>Back to the dunes, the dunes, the dunes. I didn’t lose any comrades during that trip in the dunes.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It was a perfectly executed mission. One of only a handful she had been a part of—usually their missions were "shit shows" and "slaughters." The strategy for that particular one was simple and the only one that ever worked for them: overwhelming a small force who had no idea what was coming in complete silence leaving without a word or a single gunshot.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Marta, the woman they extracted, turned out to be a scientist. This was a typical target for the resistance. What was atypical about this was that this scientist wasn't being extracted for questioning and later "disposal." This one was being picked up as a defector to the resistance.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy remembered being surprised at how forthcoming Marta was right away. Addy thought it was forthcoming to the point of carelessness. Marta's response to Addy's surprise was that she could tell they all were not government, "they moved and talked freely and joyfully". To her it was obvious, having spent her entire life "without the warmth she could feel in this group."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>They had a long friendship by Addy’s standards. One of her fondest memories of that long friendship was the first night after the extraction. The whole team met up at the checkpoint, hunkered down and dug into a sand dune. When everyone had settled in she told them all her life story.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"In grade school I was selected to be sent to a high achievement school. Every year I remained in the top 1% of test scores in my cohort, so I remained there.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The farther along we went, the more access to information we were given—scientific and other. At some point, I pieced things together from slight references in the books I was reading. The government had not always been what it said it was. Its values were not the only values out there or that ever were.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Of course, I wasn't stupid enough to ask anyone about what I was thinking. I could tell no one would be interested in my theories. Addressing the issue would certainly bring about unwanted suspicion.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Once I had earned as many university degrees as I could before it would look suspicious that I wasn't moving into a government civil service position, I took a position at the government telecommunications laboratory. What was more important was that I took up a hobby of governmental philosophical apologetics. In that way, I was able to get access to all manner of 'dissident' writings and other works. With those I could write my essays condemning their themes and theories.  All the while I was making copies of it all digitally and writing counter essays to my own essays demonstrating their flaws and discussing my real thoughts. I almost accidentally sent the wrong document once in an email. That would have been a stupid way to die."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The whole group erupted in laughter.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"I'd say that, so far, my life long subversion of the government will end in a stalemate. I may have learned a good many things about life before their takeover, but they have a bookshelf worth of stuff with my name on it saying that I endorsed them and their ideology. Yes, my counter essays exist, but the government can and will suppress them. Hopefully history will be kind to me if one day the government is dismantled and my counter essays are found with my notes on why I wrote any of it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thankfully, my scientific discoveries will be dismantled the moment I get to a secure internet connection, but they had 25 years to use it and my services. It won't take my students and scientific descendants, well government scientific puppets… I don't give them the honor of the name scientist because they don't seek the truth of the physical world, they just seek what they are told to seek. I'd say it will take those goons maybe 7 to 10 years to put everything I dismantled back together. O well. Science isn't what keeps them in power anyway."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"What will you do now?" one of the soldiers asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to find a quiet place to live out the rest of my life in peace, if such a place can be found."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy's mind drifted to the picture of Martha and her husband arm in arm in front of their cabin kissing and giving the middle finger to the government missile falling on them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What Addy knew that others didn't was that it was not a doctored photo. She had wept for days after receiving that photo by a resistance courier. The government had finally tracked her down in the forest home she had made for herself and her husband. The place was rigged up with automated perimeter defenses that could and did repel and entire platoon. They tried to push through for 3 days never reaching 1000 meters of the house. Each time they inched closer they found some new, well hidden, and ingenious trap.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Eventually after suffering losses in the hundreds the government decided to just obliterate the area with a surface to air missile. They had avoided it, because she had developed the guidance system and were afraid that she had the ability to control the missile. Instead, they dredged up and launched a missile out of storage from before she had started her work for the military.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Seeing the missile come up on radar, and knowing it was the end, Marta set herself and her husband in a clearing in front of the cabin and they used their last moment in a way that was so fitting to Marta's life. A final free moment kissing the man she loved and one final "fuck you" to the government that would live on so many years past her death. Defiant and free until her final moment.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thoughts of this image brought to mind the last moment she spent with her own husband. She saw his smile, but she banished the thought quickly, as painful memories followed along with it. Right now, although they had been before, these memories no longer helped. So far away from home there was no one to hold accountable, and no one to avenge.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Coming over another one of the endless sand dunes, Addy decided to sit and take a break. Looking at her watch she found it was time to check in with Steven.</p>

<p>"Steven, do you read me?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Checking in here, I've made it over the large dune I was telling you about in my last check-in. I am still heading south by south west."</p>

<p>"Noted, south by southwest, large dune"</p>

<p>"Over and out."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Hours more past as Addy trudged through the sands until the sun was high in the sky. She was totally exhausted after a full night of testing the range of the suit. She looked at her watch for the time as she marched onward, 3:52am her body’s time, which had nothing to do with the time of day on the planet she now found herself on trudging through sandy terrain.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>More than satisfied with the range of the suit—especially the coms, which were working just as well as when she was 10 feet outside of the box—she didn’t feel the need to go any farther east. However, a bit to the southeast she could see a fairly-large rocky hill, and thought it might have a good view of the surrounding terrain. She decided to walk to it and climb it before heading back to the box. As she approached it, she found that it was much larger and further away than she had thought it was when she first spotted it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Once Addy was most of the way up the hill, without looking at her watch to check if it was time to open coms, she said,</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Hey Steven, I can't take it anymore, I'm so bored. I don't care, even if you have to read aloud from the manual, it's just, I'm going to fall asleep walking if I don't have something to engage with other than my own thoughts and the endless sand and rocks around me. Anything approaching interesting will do."</p>

<p>"I'm at my wits end as well. This thing is less of a manual and more of a bunch of scientists showing off the sophistication of their work. I have been trying to read between the lines on all the specifics to understand how it might <em>actually</em> help us."</p>

<p>"If you want something interesting here is one, the coms that are supposed to be on in the box and bed pods are not working. So instead of talking to you through those, I am sitting in my bed with just the helmet on. It has to be a pretty comical sight."</p>

<p>"Ha! That's so adorable, I’m picturing a little kid sitting in rocket-ship-print-onesie-pajamas reading his space adventure picture book to himself before going to bed."</p>

<p>"This has to be the worst bedtime story of all time."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"What have you learned so far?"
"TThe coms work by some sort of fanciness with the black material, I don’t understand it, I think the specs on it are just to impress anyone we might find out here already has similar technology and will understand it. They do say that they should work reliably well on any interplanetary level, but not at an interstellar level. They admit it's all theory as they couldn't leave earth while developing the technology."</p>

<p>"Well that's good, that's probably farther than we'd ever need them to work."</p>

<p>"You never know how far we might need them to work."</p>

<p>"I really doubt we will ever want to be separated by an inter-planetary distance."</p>

<p>"You just don't want to be left all alone do you? You'd miss me too much."
"I'd have to know you to miss you."</p>

<p>"Well you have a 10 hour walk ahead of you and I could talk about myself all day. Ask away, I'm an open book."</p>

<p>"I know everything I need to know about you for the moment, <em>thank you</em>. I'm almost to the top of this hill. What else did you learn from the manual?"</p>

<p>"There are supposedly more controls and things than we saw when you were last in the box, but I can't find any of them. Well, I haven't looked very hard. I am trying to understand the inner workings of the box. I was hoping I might educate myself enough to fix something if it broke."</p>

<p>"You're gonna be the repair man?"</p>

<p>"No, no I am not. I would be much more likely to break everything than to fix anything based on what I am reading. The sophistication of this thing is beyond me. Anyway, that isn't what really interests me right now, what do you see out there?"</p>

<p>"Right now, my feet and the hill below them" Addy replied giving out an audible huff and puff.</p>

<p>"A bit winded, are we?"</p>

<p>"I've been walking for almost 20 hours with very little rest."</p>

<p>"With some extra gravity than you are used to."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, <em>I know</em>, I haven't forgotten about that—believe me."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There was silence for about a minute. Steven spent it flipping back through the previous pages he had just read.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"I'm to the top."</p>

<p>"What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing useful."</p>

<p>"That is not what I asked. Describe it… <em>pleeease</em>."</p>

<p>"I can see the forest back past where you are."</p>

<p>"Can you see the box, no that is a stupid question, sorry my brain is fried."</p>

<p>"If I could make you out, you'd be a tiny speck of sand just like the rest of it out there. The forest is immense. It appears to go on for farther than my eyes can see, even from this height. It wraps around the desert both to the east and the west a bit before going out to the horizon. Further south there is nothing but desert that seems to spread out more east and west as you go south."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Steven sat back in his bed-pod and continued to listen to her description.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy paused, "Looking out there on the seemingly the dessert seems infinite and the forest seems equally immense. One smashes into the other with nothing in-between. We somehow have landed on the front lines of a battle of life and death. I wish you could see it. It might be the fatigue talking but it might be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"Well if we live long enough for a leisurely walk, you can take me up there sometime."</p>

<p>"mmm… Well it's confirmed, into the jungle we go. There is nothing worth exploring to the south. I am going to head back to you in a few minutes, but first I am going to catch a quick cat nap first."</p>

<p>"Ok. Will you sleep with the com on so I can hear your breathing?"</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>"You awake?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You've been asleep for three hours. What are the readings on your battery indicator."</p>

<p>"100%"</p>

<p>"Okay just wanted to check in and make sure you didn't sleep yourself to death in a technical malfunction. Well really a death by technical function. Go back to sleep if you need to."</p>

<p>"No, I'm up, I'm going to head your way now."</p>

<p>"Okay good, because I learned some more good stuff, we have a bathroom. Well, we have a toilet and bathroom supplies. Also, we have cups."</p>

<p>"How did you figure that stuff out?"</p>

<p>"Well, I got bored and I stopped reading the sections about how the box works and more about how to operate the box. Which was about one page long. It's supposed to be all automated. Basically, none of it is working. I plan on taking another crack at some of it here in a bit. Anyway, the bathroom opened after I pawed around the wall for a bit. Also, I stuck my head down in the cupboard to find out if anything else was in there, and lo and behold, there was a roll of duct tape. It was like Christmas came early. Well actually, really, really late. We skipped a lot of Christmases didn't we?"</p>

<p>"And, where did the cups come from?"</p>

<p>"I made them out of the mission guide. I don't like drinking out of a tube. Makes me feel less," he paused, "human."</p>

<p>"Okay well I'm headed back northwest your way. Going back to five-minute check-ins."
"Before you do that, fun fact, you'll actually be heading southeast."</p>

<p>"Okay… explain."</p>

<p>"The first cup I made wasn't really intended as a cup. I built it to create a makeshift compass, using a needle from medical kit in the bathroom."</p>

<p>"What did you find in there that floats?"</p>

<p>"The food bars. So, this planet spins the opposite way around its axis."</p>

<p>"Ok Galileo, come up with any other astronomical discoveries while I was sleeping?"</p>

<p>"Nope, just terrestrial ones."</p>

<p>"I'm starting my descent. Eastward apparently."</p>

<p>"How long do you think it will take you?"</p>

<p>"Seven hours I'd say, make it eight. I'm not going to push myself unnecessarily. I do want that bed-pod <em>real</em> bad though."</p>

<p>"Do we need radio silence again?"</p>

<p>"No, if you aren't reading. That was really the only reason we had it."</p>

<p>"Okay good. What is our next move then once you get back here and get like 10 hours of sleep?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, look for water probably, but I'm too tired to think tactically or at least too tired to want to do it if I don't have to."</p>

<p>"Okay then, tell me about an especially happy memory of yours, and none of the typical resistance victory crap—something pleasant."</p>

<p>"Hmm…the first on that comes to mind happened during a week I spend at my friend's cottage out in the middle of nowhere."</p>

<p>"Middle of nowhere?"</p>

<p>"It's not important, but in the woods way off the beaten trail. Totally secluded. I went out there for a summit of regional resistance leaders, well "leaders" isn't the right word, but well respected people."</p>

<p>"This doesn't sound pleasant."</p>

<p>"What was pleasant was that most everyone brought their families. Although it was a week of tense talks and bad news, we could look out the window of the cabin and see our children playing with one another, our spouses and lovers sitting around, sipping at hot drinks in comfy chairs around actually relaxed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>At the end of the week my daughter asked if we could stay there forever. In the days before she asked me, I had already been contemplating leaving her there to be raised by my friend Marta, in safety. I remember wishing so hard that we could stay. I promised her we would come back. My husband too more seriously suggested that we did. He pointed out that it had taken a lot of effort to get out of the city. The opportunity might never come again.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The moment that came to mind when you asked was us sitting in a hammock imagining the life we could live out there. Farming, fishing, foraging, frolicking, family, we called those words the six "Fs" of our dream."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"I only counted, oh." Steven laughed cautiously. "Tell me about him. Of the three conversations we've had of any length, he has come up in almost all of them. I imagine that he was probably a pretty special person."</p>

<p>"No, decidedly not. He was my bit of ordinary and that was what I loved about him. He just was. He took things as they came and as they were. He was decent to the people around him, not because that's what he was told to do, but because he thought it was right. He didn't hide behind words, like so many people did in our time, so afraid of anyone turning them in for saying the wrong thing. He wasn't afraid of anyone because he had nothing to hide—well, until he met me. He never had anything else to hide because his motives, if he ever had any, were pure and were for the good of those around him.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Also, I should probably apologize for jumping down your throat when we first were introduced. I don't trust people, especially men, especially when I first meet them. I use that as a way to disarm men who I first meet. Especially young men with sex on their mind."</p>

<p>"I wasn't"</p>

<p>"Men your age, whether they know it or not, are think about sex as long as you aren't at that moment fighting for their lives."</p>

<p>"That's not entirely fair."</p>

<p>"You are right, you could try saving yourself in dire straits by selling your body for bread, so it's possible to be thinking about both."</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry about that now. I'm thousands of years old."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy gave no response.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"I'm going to get you to laugh at one of my jokes someday. Anyway, you think so little of us men, when it sounds like you had a good one yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll laugh when you say something funny. Also, don't misunderstand, his lower desire to survive and higher desire for sex with me was of my favorite of his qualities. You are putting your own judgements on my words."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Now it's your turn to answer. What is a pleasant memory of yours?"</p>

<p>"I actually have a lot, surprising as it might seem because of the world we come from. Being a spy had its advantages. I lived at the top of society—fancy parties, weekends at estates in the country, that sort of thing. A particularly pleasant weekend was one where I was invited to a weekend long party put on at the governor's country estate. No one showed, not even the governor. Something important happened that kept them all in the city and in meetings. I never found out what.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I arrived a little early and the house staff told me to make myself comfortable for the weekend and that the govern had given me the run of the place. I had a whole weekend more or less to myself, apart from the staff. I went on walks. I read books from his immense library. I didn't have to do anything. No sneaking, no trying to overhear conversations as I moved through a room full of people. Just silence and books. Oh, and the food! They asked me what I wanted to eat. I just told them vegetables. He kept a massive garden on the grounds. I probably ate 5 pounds of tomatoes that weekend. Hmmm. That's a sad thought, I may never get to eat a tomato again."</p>

<p>"I've never had one."</p>

<p>"Maybe the food on this world will be even better than what we eat on earth."</p>

<p>"Or it will kill you."</p>

<p>"Why can't it be both."</p>

<p>"Those meal bars won’t last forever—thankfully. I'd rather die quickly than eat those things for any extended period of time."</p>

<p>"You don't have permission to die."</p>

<p>"Who do I need permission from?"</p>

<p>"I'll go with… any two-other people from the planet earth."</p>

<p>"Do you really think we're going to make it back?"</p>

<p>"We don't know enough yet to not at least try."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy was not inspired by this lack of an answer but didn't want to press further.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There was silence on the coms for several minutes. Addy though of Earth, and the tiny apartment she left behind, lights still on, food in the cupboard. She wondered who lived in it after her.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>What did they do there? Were they happy? We're they free like her, we're they brainwashed like everyone else, or we're they free in some other way</em>?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Where did you live back on earth?"</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Addy got no response.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Steven?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, I dosed off."</p>

<p>"No, go back to sleep. I'll be back right about when you wake up."</p>

<p>The sun still high in the sky, Addy marched down the hill and through the dunes back toward the box.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>After several more hours of walking, Addy made it back to the box. She pressed the airlock open button and after a few moments the door released. She stepped inside, closing the door behind her. Once it was sealed, she took off her helmet and hung it on its hook. A few moments later the middle doorway opened, as it opened she heard Steven exclaim, "What the fuck, where is the fucking thing?! Is this some sick fucking joke you assholes!?"</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Who are you yelling at?"</p>

<p>"Some long dead scientists and engineers."</p>

<p>"So, I take it you didn't sleep long."</p>

<p>"No, I was too pissed that I couldn't figure out how to use this fucking box."</p>

<p>"Okay well, I'm more tired than I've ever been in my entire life and you're between me and the only bed I know of in the entire universe. So, if you don't get out of my way, I'm going to drop you."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Steven sat on his bed-pod with a huff. Addy laid down in her bed-pod. After a few seconds Steven asked, "Are you going to sleep in your suit?"</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>He got no response.</p>

<p><em>Already out I guess I should sleep too. Best to stay on the same sleep schedule</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Good night friend," he whispered and laid down in his bed.</p>
